    "We can observe that the precision-recall relationship is quite constant for the different values, indicating that our model has a good precision and recall. This is due to the fact that the True Positive values are quite high compared to the true negative, false positive and false negative. It is important to remember that because of the formula of recall and precision, when one is high the other one is low pushing us to find a balance where both are high enough for our model."
